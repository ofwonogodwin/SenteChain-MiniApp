# Testing Balance Display Fix

## Issue Fixed
Deposits were succeeding but balance wasn't updating on the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Delay (dashboard.jsx)
- Added 1.5 second delay before refreshing balance after deposit
- This ensures blockchain state is fully updated before reading

### 2. Fresh Provider (contract.js)
- Force fresh provider in `getUserBalance()` and `getSavingsBalance()`
- Prevents reading stale cached data
- Added console logging to track balance values

### 3. Existing Mechanisms
- WalletCard already has manual refresh button (üîÑ)
- All transaction forms already wait 2 seconds before refreshing
- RefreshKey mechanism forces WalletCard to remount and reload

## How to Test

### Step 1: Ensure Hardhat is Running
```bash
cd /home/godwin-ofwono/Desktop/EthNile/SenteChainMiniApp/smart_contracts
npx hardhat node
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
cd /home/godwin-ofwono/Desktop/EthNile/SenteChainMiniApp/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Deposit Flow
1. **Login** to the app (username: `test`, password: `test123`)
2. **Click "Connect Wallet"** button
3. **Claim faucet** first if balance is 0 (click "üö∞ Claim 100 sUSDT")
4. **Wait for faucet transaction** to complete and balance to show (should auto-refresh)
5. **Click "Deposit to Vault"** button
6. **Enter amount** (e.g., `10`)
7. **Approve** the transaction in MetaMask
8. **Wait** for approval confirmation
9. **Confirm deposit** in MetaMask
10. **Watch** - After 1.5 seconds, balance should automatically update
11. **If needed** - Click the üîÑ Refresh button manually

### Step 4: Check Console
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
Balance for 0x... : XX.XX sUSDT
```

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Transaction shows "Deposited X sUSDT to vault!" toast
- After 1.5 seconds, "Available Balance" updates automatically
- Console shows: `Balance for 0x...: XX.XX sUSDT`
- Manual refresh button also updates balance

### ‚ùå If Still Not Working
1. Check Hardhat node is running
2. Verify contract addresses in `frontend/config/contracts.json`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try manual refresh (üîÑ button)
5. Try refreshing the entire page

## Understanding the Balances

### Available Balance (Main Card)
- Shows: `vault.getBalance(address)`
- Updated by: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `transfer()`
- This is what you see after depositing to vault

### Savings Vault Balance (Yellow Card)
- Shows: `vault.getSavingsBalance(address)`
- Updated by: `saveToVault()`, `withdrawFromVault()`
- This is for locked savings (different from deposits)

## Quick Debug Commands

### Check balance directly from Hardhat
```bash
cd smart_contracts
npx hardhat console --network localhost

# Then in console:
const SenteVault = await ethers.getContractFactory("SenteVault");
const vault = await SenteVault.attach("0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9");
const balance = await vault.getBalance("YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS");
console.log(ethers.formatUnits(balance, 6));
```

## For Your Pitch

Key points to mention:
1. ‚úÖ **Instant deposits** - Transactions confirm in seconds on Base L2
2. ‚úÖ **Auto-refresh** - Balance updates automatically after transactions
3. ‚úÖ **Manual refresh** - Users can manually refresh with üîÑ button
4. ‚úÖ **Gasless transfers** - Transfers within vault have no gas fees
5. ‚úÖ **Locked savings** - Users can lock funds for guaranteed savings

## Next Steps After Pitch

If you want to deploy to Base Sepolia testnet:
1. Get Base Sepolia ETH from faucet
2. Update `hardhat.config.js` with your private key
3. Deploy: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia`
4. Update contract addresses in frontend
5. Update network in `connectWallet.js` to use Base Sepolia

Good luck with your pitch! üöÄ
